# Charwork Technical Whitepaper

**v1.1.0** | August 2026

Wireframes made of characters.

Pick a component, stamp it on a monospace grid, copy the result as text. It pastes
into a commit message, a code comment, a chat. No image anywhere. Live at
[wiretext.heyitsmejosh.com](https://wiretext.heyitsmejosh.com).

## Core Mechanic: The Character Grid

The document is `state.grid: string[][]`, a 100×50 2D array of characters.
Everything is a pure function over that array:

- **Components**: 23 presets (`src/lib/presets.js`), Button through Skeleton,
  each a small template of box-drawing characters.
- **Stamping**: `stampComponent(grid, template, col, row)` returns a new grid
  with the template written in; the reducer never mutates. Immutability makes
  undo/redo (50 steps) a matter of keeping old grids.
- **Export**: `gridToText(grid)` joins rows into the final plain-text
  wireframe for `.txt` download or clipboard copy.

The canvas (`src/components/Canvas.jsx`) renders the grid to an HTML canvas in
a monospace font, converts pointer position to cells via `pxToCell`, and shows
a hover preview of the selected component before placing.

## Architecture

- **Stack**: Vite 6 + React 19, no external UI libraries.
- **State**: one root reducer in `App.jsx` (SELECT_PRESET, PLACE_COMPONENT,
  UNDO, REDO, CLEAR).
- **UI**: `Toolbar.jsx` (palette grouped by category), `Inspector.jsx`
  (cursor coords, preset preview, history counts).
- **Design**: dark-mode only, exact portfolio tokens from
  warm paper (#FAF9F5 bg, #D97757 accent, system sans). The shared
  tokens.css is still imported, then overridden in `src/index.css` -- Charwork
  matches its own iOS app rather than the portfolio.

## iOS

Native SwiftUI (xcodegen), rewritten in August 2026 from the original
WKWebView shell. The shell had to serve its build over a custom `app://`
scheme because ES module scripts are blocked cross-origin under `file://`;
the native port removed that workaround along with the embedded web build.
Remaining before App Store submission: generate an AppIcon asset catalog from
`icon.svg`.

## Privacy

Fully client-side. No accounts, no network calls, no storage beyond the
in-memory grid, close the tab and the document is gone unless exported.
